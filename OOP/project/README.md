# TRAFFIC SIMULATOR


### Instructions:
* Press 1 for first strategy
* Press 2 for second strategy


### First Strategy:
Two cars from opposite directions will move while other two will stop. For example, when cars coming from North and South have the green signal, East and West will not move and vice versa.

### Second Strategy:
Cars will come randomly from any direction but one at a time. One traffic light will be green and the cars can randomly take turns or go straight.
